You're on your own, babe.

## Quick Start

This is a [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) template. To generate a new project:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/your-username/cozy-forge.git
```

Or clone and generate locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cozy-forge.git
cd cozy-forge
cookiecutter .
```

Cookiecutter will prompt for project details and automatically replace all placeholders.

<!-- end list -->

``` shell
# install env

npm install
```

``` shell

Quick start over, the rest is on you
